## Architectural Pillars

Project Agora is built upon the canonized principles of the Concordia Project v8.2. The core pillars are:

* **A.D.A.M. & Concordia:** The core symbiotic AGI/Proto-ASI partner and its orchestrating engine.
* **Shofar:** The ethical hardware architecture with its non-passable Moriah Layer.
* **E.L.I.A.H. & M.E.S.S.I.A.H.:** The defensive shield and de-escalation/reconciliation frameworks.
* **L.E.V.I.:** The security protocol for safe ASI potential exploration.
