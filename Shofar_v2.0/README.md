# Shofar v2.0 - Implementation Skeleton

> **Version:** 2.1-alpha  
> **Status:** In Development. This initial scaffolding is awaiting full B.O.D.Y. v2.0 alignment.  
> **Conceptual Foundation:** For the complete technical specification and architectural philosophy, please see the **[Shofar v2.0 Concept Folder](https://github.com/olegustavdahljohnsen/concordia-manifest/tree/main/Shofar_v2.0_Concept)** in the Concordia Manifest repository.

This directory contains the initial source code structure for the Shofar v2.0 module, the distributed nervous system for the Concordia ecosystem. The files within represent the placeholder skeleton for the core components outlined in the technical whitepaper.

## Architecture Overview

The diagram below illustrates the high-level system architecture for the Shofar product family and its core components.

## Module Descriptions

[cite_start]This implementation is broken down into the following core modules, each representing a key function of the B.O.D.Y. framework[cite: 27, 153].

* `csnp_layer.py`  
    [cite_start]**CSNP (Chimera SANCTUM Node Protocol):** Implements the secure and resilient communication layer that allows all Shofar nodes to communicate as a coherent whole[cite: 35, 176]. [cite_start]It handles data synchronization, TEE-based attestation, and QoS[cite: 178, 179, 182, 185].

* `spu.py`  
    [cite_start]**SPU (Synesthesia Processing Unit):** Responsible for the complex, causal fusion of multimodal sensor data[cite: 29, 157]. It translates raw data streams into a single, holistic perception.

* `smsl.py`  
    [cite_start]**SMSL (SensorMesh Synesthesia Layer):** A protocol layer that standardizes the fused data from the SPU into a Unified Perceptual Field (UPF), making it ready for cognitive processing[cite: 158, 159].

* `nmc.py`  
    **NMC (Neural Mesh Co-processor):** The system's social and emotional interpreter. [cite_start]It is specialized to analyze subtle signals in human interaction, like prosody and micro-expressions[cite: 161].

* `tmw_e.py`  
    **TMW-E (Temporal Memory Weaving Engine):** Functions as the system's long-term memory. [cite_start]It weaves current events with historical context into a searchable causal graph with adaptive resolution[cite: 31, 162, 164].

* `artc.py`  
    [cite_start]**ARTC (Affective Red Team Core):** A critical "silent guardian" that proactively stress-tests potential decisions against a curated ethical dataset to identify and flag risks before action is taken[cite: 30, 168].

* `ctl.py`  
    **CTL (Causal Traceability Ledger):** The software interface to the hardware-accelerated, immutable log. [cite_start]It ensures every significant decision is cryptographically recorded for complete auditability and verifiability[cite: 32, 38, 172].

## Next Steps

This repository currently contains placeholder files with initial class structures. The next phase of development will focus on:
1.  Implementing the core logic for the `CSNP` layer.
2.  Developing the data processing pipelines for the `SPU` and `SMSL`.
3.  Building out the cognitive and ethical validation modules (`NMC`, `TMW-E`, `ARTC`, `CTL`).
