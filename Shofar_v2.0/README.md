# Shofar v2.0 - Implementation Skeleton

> **Version:** 2.1-alpha  
> **Status:** In Development. This initial scaffolding is awaiting full B.O.D.Y. v2.0 alignment.  
> **Conceptual Foundation:** For the complete technical specification and architectural philosophy, please see the **[Shofar v2.0 Concept Folder](https://github.com/olegustavdahljohnsen/concordia-manifest/tree/main/Shofar_v2.0_Concept)** in the Concordia Manifest repository.

[cite_start]This directory contains the initial source code structure for the Shofar v2.0 module, the distributed nervous system for the Concordia ecosystem[cite: 11, 12]. [cite_start]The files within represent the placeholder skeleton for the core components outlined in the technical whitepaper[cite: 2].

## Module Descriptions

[cite_start]This implementation is broken down into the following components, each representing a key function of the **B.O.D.Y. framework**[cite: 27, 153].

### Core Cognitive & Data Pipeline
* [cite_start]`spu.py`: **SPU (Synesthesia Processing Unit)** - Responsible for the complex, causal fusion of multimodal sensor data into a holistic perception[cite: 29, 157].
* [cite_start]`smsl.py`: **SMSL (SensorMesh Synesthesia Layer)** - A protocol layer that standardizes fused data into a **Unified Perceptual Field (UPF)**[cite: 158, 159].
* [cite_start]`nmc.py`: **NMC (Neural Mesh Co-processor)** - The system's social and emotional interpreter, specialized to analyze subtle signals in human interaction[cite: 161].
* [cite_start]`tmw_e.py`: **TMW-E (Temporal Memory Weaving Engine)** - Functions as the system's long-term memory, weaving events into a searchable causal graph[cite: 31, 162].

### Governance, Security & Ethics
* [cite_start]`ctl.py`: **CTL (Causal Traceability Ledger)** - The software interface to the hardware-accelerated, immutable log for complete auditability[cite: 32, 38, 172].
* [cite_start]`artc.py`: **ARTC (Affective Red Team Core)** - A "silent guardian" that proactively stress-tests potential decisions against an ethical dataset[cite: 30, 168].
* [cite_start]`attestation.py`: Implements the client-side logic for remote attestation to verify the integrity of other Shofar nodes[cite: 147].
* [cite_start]`keymgr.py`: Manages the lifecycle of cryptographic keys, including Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC)[cite: 96, 211].
* [cite_start]`privacy.py`: A toolkit for applying privacy-enhancing technologies like differential privacy to data[cite: 268].
* [cite_start]`zk_export.py`: Generates Zero-Knowledge Proofs from the CTL to allow for privacy-preserving audits[cite: 269].

### System, Network & Visualization
* [cite_start]`csnp_layer.py`: **CSNP (Chimera SANCTUM Node Protocol)** - Implements the secure and resilient communication layer for the entire network[cite: 35, 176].
* [cite_start]`qos_scheduler.py`: Manages and prioritizes data flow and tasks based on the strict QoS hierarchy (Safety-Critical, Ethics-Critical, etc.)[cite: 119, 185].
* `device_registry.py`: Manages the registration, status, and capabilities of all trusted nodes in the network.
* [cite_start]`failover.py`: Handles CSNP client resilience, including offline journaling and graceful degradation during network outages[cite: 36, 183].
* [cite_start]`telemetry.py`: The observability hub, implementing hooks for OpenTelemetry and integrating with the CTL for real-time analysis[cite: 221, 222].
* [cite_start]`thvi.py`: The backend API for the **Trust Horizon Visualization Interface**, preparing data for rendering risk cones and policy tensions[cite: 189, 192].
* [cite_start]`vpu.py`: A software "shim" for the **Visualization Processing Unit**, designed to offload heavy rendering tasks[cite: 173, 190].

### Sub-Packages
* `schemas/`: Contains the formal data structure definitions (e.g., for the UPF and Policy files) to ensure data consistency.
* [cite_start]`policy_studio/`: A toolkit for defining, linting, and compiling human-readable ethical policies into a machine-enforceable format[cite: 196, 198].
* [cite_start]`bridges/`: Provides the interoperability layer to connect Shofar with standard ML frameworks like ONNX and PyTorch/XLA[cite: 219, 220].
* [cite_start]`devkit/`: A developer toolkit with tools like a synthetic sensor stream generator and "ethical unit tests"[cite: 225, 226].
* `tests/`: Contains all unit, integration, and smoke tests for the modules.

## Next Steps

This repository now contains a comprehensive placeholder structure. The development roadmap is as follows:
1.  Finalize the data contracts in the `schemas/` package.
2.  Implement the foundational modules: `CSNP` for networking and `CTL` for logging.
3.  Build out the core data pipeline: `SPU` -> `SMSL` -> `NMC` & `TMW-E`.
4.  Implement the full governance loop: `Policy Studio` for defining rules and `ARTC` for validating them.
5.  Develop the `bridges` for external framework integration.
