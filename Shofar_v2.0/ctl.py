This file will contain the software interface for the CTL (Causal Traceability 
Ledger). While the core ledger is hardware-accelerated, this module will 
provide the API for writing to, and securely exporting data from, the 
immutable log. It ensures that every significant decision is cryptographically 
logged for auditing and verifiability.
