This file will contain the implementation for the SPU (Synesthesia Processing
Unit). Its core responsibility is to perform complex, causal fusion of 
multimodal data streams (e.g., audio, visual, LiDAR). It translates raw 
sensory input into a coherent, holistic perceptual field for the A.D.A.M. 
system to interpret.
