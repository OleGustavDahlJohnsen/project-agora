This file will house the logic for the TMW-E (Temporal Memory Weaving 
Engine). This serves as A.D.A.M.'s long-term memory. Its function is to 
weave current sensory input together with historical events into a complex, 
searchable causal graph, operating with adaptive resolution to prioritize 
significant memories.
