# Methodology: Symbiotic Genesis

The design philosophy of Agora rests on a constitutionally inspired simulation methodology known as **Symbiotic Genesis**. Its methodology can be distilled into five procedural commitments:

1.  **Simulated Multilateralism:** All architectural modules are developed through adversarial agent-based simulation to mimic real-world dissent and edge-case friction.
2.  **Iterative Ethical Layering:** Each new feature passes three ethical stages—Isolation, Contextualization, and Reconciliation—before integration.
3.  **Narrative Anchoring:** AI decision trees are stress-tested via narrative simulation across thousands of ethical dilemmas derived from fiction, philosophy, and real-world case law.
4.  **Triadic Verification:** All critical systems are validated through the PORTA SANCTA loop, which consists of a logic-checker, an ethical-checker, and a contradiction-sentinel.
5.  **Rollback Falsifiability:** A principle demanding that all subsystems must be reversible, explainable, and interruptible.

This framework is not just technical—it is political, moral, and epistemic. The system’s conscience is not embedded in code alone, but in processual transparency. To ensure scientific reproducibility, all simulation logs, decision protocols, and emergent specifications are available through a public Simulation Replay Engine and a Decision Audit Trail with AI-signed commits.
