# Implementation: The Project Agora MVP

The MVP's implementation materializes the architectural blueprint using a modern, robust technology stack, translating theory into functional code.

The core logic is developed in **Python**, leveraging its extensive ecosystem for AI and data processing, while the simulation's kernel is designed to be rewritten in **Rust** for high performance and memory safety as a "Path Forward" objective. The system operates as an event-driven, asynchronous application to enable sub-second context shifts between modules.

Upon this kernel sits a semantic NLP layer, using pre-trained transformer models to prioritize human dignity in ambiguous scenarios. The hardware anchor, the **Shofar Emulator**, is realized as a hardened Python microservice capable of injecting interrupt-signals based on 16-tier ethical heuristics.

The **ELIAH Protocol** is a functional prototype with token-based emotional attenuation and real-time veto logic.

Finally, the governance model is brought to life through a **Triad Council Simulation**, a three-agent loop using contrasting personality embeddings—Utilitarian, Deontological, and Relational—to simulate ethical disagreement and achieve robust decisions.

All modules run within an encrypted, containerized microservice environment, where logging and override commands are cryptographically bound to session-specific audits.
