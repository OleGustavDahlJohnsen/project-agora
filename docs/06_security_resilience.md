# Security & Adversarial Resilience

In the pursuit of symbiotic AI that fosters human flourishing, Project Agora must confront the inherent vulnerabilities of advanced systems to malicious exploitation. This section delineates our comprehensive strategy for fortifying the Concordia Architecture against such threats.

### Threat Modeling: Identifying and Mitigating Potential Attack Vectors

Threat modeling forms the foundational step in Agora's security posture. We adopt a hybrid approach combining established frameworks like **MITRE ATLAS** and **NIST's Adversarial Machine Learning Taxonomy**. Key attack vectors modeled include Data Poisoning, Evasion and Inversion Attacks, Supply Chain Threats, and long-term Emergent Misalignment. Mitigation involves cryptographic hashing of datasets, runtime anomaly detection via the SANCTUM TrustKernel, and provenance tracking in the RollbackArchive.

### Adversarial Attack Resistance: Strategies Against Prompt Injection, Moral Evasion, and Sensor-Trojaning

Agora's design embeds multi-layered defenses against adversarial techniques.
* **Prompt Injection Resistance** is achieved through NLP-based separation of trusted system prompts and untrusted user prompts, using token-level isolation and recursive verification.
* **Moral Evasion Resistance** is enforced by the MessiahFramework's non-bypassable reconciliation protocols, which use emergent alignment to self-correct deviations from the Prime Directive.
* **Sensor-Trojaning Resistance** is anchored in the Shofar Emulator, which acts as a sentinel, verifying sensor inputs against baseline patterns and detecting anomalies.

### Zero Trust Principles: Implementing a Never-Trust, Always-Verify Posture

A **Zero Trust (ZT) architecture** underpins Agora's security, operating on the principle of continuous verification rather than assumed trust. This manifests through granular controls where no entity is implicitly trusted.
* Components run in **isolated containers** enforcing least-privilege access.
* The **API Gateway** authenticates all interactions using multi-factor challenges.
* **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** enforces explicit verification, with roles tied to ethical scopes.
