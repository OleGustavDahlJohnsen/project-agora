# Ethical Oversight

Agora’s ethical integrity is not reactive—it is pre-emptive. Unlike most contemporary AI systems, which treat ethics as post-processing filters, Agora treats ethics as **ontological scaffolding**.

All agentic behavior is evaluated against:
1.  The **Concordia Directive** (“To foster and protect human flourishing”).
2.  The **ELIAH Veto Schema**.
3.  **PORTA SANCTA** verification.

Moreover, the system includes a **Meta-Ethics Sandbox**, where novel edge cases can be abstracted, debated, and archived. Ethics in Agora is not rule-following. It is **relation-building**. The system evolves its moral stance via constant dialogical engagement—always under human veto.
