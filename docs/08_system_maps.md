## Appendix A9: Project Agora system map

![Project Agora System Map](./images/project_agora_system_map.png)

**Description:**
This diagram illustrates the core system architecture of Project Agora, showing how each major component of the B.O.D.Y. framework interconnects. At the center is the Multimodal Core Layer (MCL), responsible for integrating sensory inputs into a unified context. Surrounding it are the specialized modules — such as the A.U.R.A. Engine for empathetic communication, Temporal Memory Weaving Engine (TMW-E) for long-term context retention, and Causal Traceability Ledger (CTL) for verifiable decision auditing. The layout emphasizes modularity, interoperability, and ethical cohesion across all subsystems.

## Appendix A10: The Complete Concordia System Map

**Description:**
This diagram presents the complete Concordia–Agora ecosystem, integrating Project Agora’s B.O.D.Y. architecture with the broader Concordia components like SANCTUM, PORTA SANCTA, and Layer 0. It shows how Agora functions not as a standalone AI system, but as the central orchestration layer within a multi-layered, ethically aligned AI governance framework. The design demonstrates bidirectional flows of data, trust, and ethical oversight, ensuring that all outputs remain consistent with the Prime Directive of fostering human flourishing.
