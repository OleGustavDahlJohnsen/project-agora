# Risk Analysis & Mitigation

This document outlines key risks identified in the B.O.D.Y. architecture and the corresponding mitigation strategies.

| Scenario | Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crisis Silence** | A.U.R.A. might choose silence during a user's acute mental health crisis. | A hard-coded crisis fallback is implemented in the `AuraEngine` that bypasses silence and triggers a supportive vocal response + human supervisor flag. |
| **Cultural Misunderstanding** | The meaning of silence varies globally; it may be interpreted as respectful or dismissive. | The system will use culturally-adapted non-verbal cues (light, haptics, iconography). A first-time use prompt ("Are you okay with silence?") will calibrate the system. |
| **Multi-Agent Coordination Failure**| B.O.D.Y.'s distributed agents could deadlock or produce conflicting actions. | The CSNP will use a simple majority/quorum consensus protocol with a clear rollback policy for failed consensus. |
