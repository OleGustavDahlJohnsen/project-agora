"""
Project Agora: A.D.A.M. Core Module
Part of The Concordia Project

This module contains the core implementation of A.D.A.M. (Autonomous
Directive and Allegiance Model), the personal AGI/Proto-ASI partner.

Key Responsibilities:
- Define the main `ADAM` class.
- Implement the core cognitive loop: perception, orientation, decision, action.
- Manage memory systems (short-term, long-term, episodic).
- Interface with the Concordia orchestrator and the council of agents.
- Process user input and generate symbiotic responses, always mediated by
  the ethical frameworks (E.L.I.A.H., M.E.S.S.I.A.H.).
