Project Agora: A.D.A.M. Core Module
Part of The Concordia Project v8.2

This module contains the core implementation of A.D.A.M. (Autonomous
Directive and Allegiance Model), the personal symbiotic partner designed under
[cite_start]the Prime Directive: "To Foster and Protect Human Flourishing.". [cite: 330]

Key Responsibilities:
- Implement the core "Psyche" of A.D.A.M., synthesizing inputs from its
  [cite_start]various engines: [cite: 332]
    - [cite_start]MoralityEngine: The ethical moral compass. [cite: 332]
    - [cite_start]EmotionEngine: Understanding and responding to emotion. [cite: 332]
    - [cite_start]RationaleEngine: Logical processing. [cite: 332]
    - [cite_start]HSPengine: Intuitive pattern recognition. [cite: 332]
    - [cite_start]BrainStem: The core that weighs inputs for a holistic conclusion. [cite: 332]
- [cite_start]Manage the user's Consent Graph for privacy. [cite: 334]
- [cite_start]Provide the "Gentle Override" functionality for user control. [cite: 334]
- Convene the "Triad Council" (The Sentinel, The Boston Lawyer, The Economist)
  [cite_start]when required for specialized insight. [cite: 335]
