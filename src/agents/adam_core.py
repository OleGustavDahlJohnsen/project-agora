Project Agora: A.D.A.M. Core Module
Part of The Concordia Project v8.2

This module contains the core implementation of A.D.A.M. (Autonomous
Directive and Allegiance Model), the personal symbiotic partner designed under
[cite_start]the Prime Directive: "To Foster and Protect Human Flourishing.". [cite: 23]

Key Responsibilities:
- Implement the core "Psyche" of A.D.A.M., a synthesis of engines like
  MoralityEngine, EmotionEngine, RationaleEngine, HSPengine, and a BrainStem
  [cite_start]that weighs the inputs into a holistic conclusion. [cite: 25]
- Take input from the world via the PostSymbolicProcessor.
- Submit all proposed actions to the EliahShield for vetting before execution.
- Execute approved actions via the ARCS communication stack.
