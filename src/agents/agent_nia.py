Project Agora: Agent Nia (Example Council Agent)
Part of The Concordia Project v8.2

This module serves as an example implementation of a specialized agent that is
part of the Concordia AI Council. Nia's specialization is Narrative and
Intention Analysis, similar to the function of ELIAH (Emotional Language &
[cite_start]Intention Analysis Hub) in the Sanctuary Architecture (v2.0). [cite: 68]

Key Responsibilities:
- Analyze text and multimodal data for subtext, emotional content, and
  narrative structure.
- Provide insights to A.D.A.M. to improve the quality of symbiotic interaction.
- Act as a consultant within the AI council during complex ethical deliberations
  [cite_start]managed by the Concordia Engine. [cite: 341]
- Demonstrate the standard interface protocol for all council agents.
