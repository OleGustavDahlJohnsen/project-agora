"""
Project Agora: ARCS Module
Part of the CHIMERA SANCTUM Architecture v1.0

Implements ARCS (ADAM Resonant Communication Stack), the specialized, layered
[cite_start]network that enables post-symbolic communication. [cite: 28, 166]

Key Responsibilities:
- Manage the redundant, multi-layered communication channels to ensure
  [cite_start]continuous connection under all conditions. [cite: 167]
- Support multiple channel types: Laserlink (LIDR), Radio (Multi-band),
  [cite_start]SensorMesh (Local), and the experimental ELIAH-Wave. [cite: 168]
- Implement the resonance-based anti-jamming philosophy, where meaning is
  carried by a dynamic pattern across multiple layers, making single-channel
  [cite_start]jamming ineffective. [cite: 169, 170]
- Recompose messages via remaining channels if one is cut, preserving
  [cite_start]semantic continuity. [cite: 172]
