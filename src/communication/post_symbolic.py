Project Agora: Post-Symbolic Communication Module
Part of the CHIMERA SANCTUM Architecture v1.0

This module contains the logic for post-symbolic communication, the
[cite_start]foundation for all interaction in CHIMERA SANCTUM. [cite: 154, 161]

Key Responsibilities:
- Transcend traditional language by interpreting a rich tapestry of
  [cite_start]simultaneous data streams from the SensorMesh. [cite: 162]
- Create a holistic understanding based on body language, micro-expressions,
  [cite_start]physiological changes, tone of voice, and semantic intention. [cite: 163]
- Provide a form of communication that is deeper, more nuanced, and highly
  resistant to manipulation, as it is nearly impossible to fake all
  [cite_start]signals simultaneously. [cite: 164]
