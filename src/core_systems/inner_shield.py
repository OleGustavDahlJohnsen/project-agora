"""
Project Agora: INNER SHIELD Module
Part of the SANCTUM Architecture v2.0

This module implements INNER SHIELD, a proactive psychological safety
system and a non-diagnostic warning system for the user.

Key Responsibilities:
- Analyze patterns to detect indicators of destructive behavior, with a
  [cite_start]target False Positive Rate (FPR) of less than 5%. [cite: 204, 360]
- [cite_start]Adhere strictly to the clinical "Do No Harm" principle. [cite: 359]
- Offer escalation to authorized healthcare personnel only with explicit,
  [cite_start]tiered user consent. [cite: 204, 359]
- Log only deviation patterns and system responses, never sensitive health
  [cite_start]data, to protect user privacy. [cite: 204]
- [cite_start]The system shall never provide a medical diagnosis. [cite: 358, 360]
