"""
Project Agora: Rollback Archive Module
Part of the SANCTUM Architecture v2.0

This module implements the Rollback Archive, a critical component ensuring
that all actions and system states are reversible.

Key Responsibilities:
- Maintain three independent, encrypted buffers to guarantee reversibility. [cite: 204]
- Provide activation mechanisms that can be triggered by the user ("Safe Retreat"),
  the system (anomaly detection), or the Triad Council (at DEFCON 2+). [cite: 204]
- Store a pseudonymized history to enable a full rollback with a targeted
  Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of less than 5 minutes. [cite: 204]
- The user's right to trigger Safe Retreat is absolute and cannot be
  overridden except by dual authorization in extreme cases. [cite: 211, 245]
