Project Agora: Trust Kernel Module
Part of the SANCTUM Architecture v2.0

This module implements the Trust Kernel, a core component of the SANCTUM
technological platform, responsible for guaranteeing identity and security.

Key Responsibilities:
- Guarantee the identity of both the user and the ADAM instance. [cite: 204]
- Manage biometric and cryptographic authentication, using HSM/KMS-based
  key management. [cite: 204]
- Interface with PORTA SANCTA to get ethical token validation for
  high-risk operations (DEFCON 3+). [cite: 204]
- Write signed, irreversible events to a short-term security buffer with a
  maximum retention of 72 hours and an RPO < 1 minute. [cite: 204]
