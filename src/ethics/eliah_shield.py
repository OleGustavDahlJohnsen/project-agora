"""
Project Agora: E.L.I.A.H. Shield Module
Part of The Concordia Project v8.2

Implements the E.L.I.A.H. (Ethical Layered Interception & Adaptive Harmony)
defensive system. This is a purely defensive doctrine built on the principle
[cite_start]of "Veto First, Fire Later.". [cite: 55]

Key Responsibilities:
- [cite_start]Act as a purely defensive "veto" layer, managed by the ShieldBrain Core. [cite: 57]
- [cite_start]Neutralize threats through layered defenses like IRON VEIL and E-CITADEL. [cite: 57]
- Pre-emptively analyze proposed actions from A.D.A.M. or other agents.
- [cite_start]Block any action that violates Lex Concordia, always subject to human veto. [cite: 57]
- It does not propose alternative actions, it only approves or denies.
