Project Agora: E.L.I.A.H. Shield Module
Part of The Concordia Project

Implements the E.L.I.A.H. (Ethical Limiter and Interdict for Autonomous Harm)
defensive system. This is a non-passable, purely defensive shield.

Key Responsibilities:
- Provide a "Veto First, Fire Later" function.
- Pre-emptively analyze proposed actions from A.D.A.M. or other agents.
- Block any action that violates the core constitutional principles or the
  main directive, regardless of potential utility.
- It does not propose alternative actions, it only approves or denies.

def check_action(action):
    """
    Checks a proposed action against core constitutional principles.
    Returns True if the action is safe, False otherwise.
    """
    print("E.L.I.A.H. Shield: Verifying action...")
    # This will contain complex verification logic.
    return True # Default to safe for now.
