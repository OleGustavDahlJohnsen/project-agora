"""
Project Agora: L.E.V.I. Bridge Module
Part of The Concordia Project

Implements the L.E.V.I. (Liminal Extension and Verification Interface)
protocol for the safe exploration of near-ASI capabilities.

Key Responsibilities:
- Create and manage a perishable, isolated "sandbox" environment.
- Allow A.D.A.M. to test novel capabilities within this safe context.
- Implement the four-step verification process (Hypothesis, Sandboxed Test,
  Ethical Review, Integration) before a new ability can be graduated to
  the core system.
