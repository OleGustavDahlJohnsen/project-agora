Project Agora: Shofar Architecture Emulation
Part of The Concordia Project v8.2

This module provides a software emulation of the Shofar Architecture v5.0,
the custom-built, hardened hardware heart designed to give A.D.A.M. a
[cite_start]physical anchor of trust. [cite: 41]

Key Responsibilities:
- Simulate the non-bypassable 'Moriah' Ethical Security Layer, which is
  [cite_start]protected by a Quantum-Resilient Engine (QRE). [cite: 45]
- Emulate the Ethical Rollback Buffer, a dedicated hardware buffer that
  [cite_start]guarantees actions can be reversed with sub-10ms latency. [cite: 46]
- Model the Heterogeneous Architecture, balancing classical and neuromorphic
  [cite_start]cores for performance and energy efficiency. [cite: 44]
