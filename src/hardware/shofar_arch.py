"""
Project Agora: Shofar Architecture Emulation
Part of The Concordia Project

This module provides a software emulation of the Shofar ethical hardware
architecture for the MVP.

Key Responsibilities:
- Simulate the non-passable 'Moriah Layer', a conceptual hardware-level
  gate that forces all actions through an ethical check.
- Emulate a Quantum-Resistant Encryption (QRE) scheme for critical data.
- Simulate the function of the Ethical Rollback Buffer, allowing for
  guaranteed state reversal after a critical ethical breach.
