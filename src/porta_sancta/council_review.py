Project Agora: PORTA SANCTA - Council Review
Part of the PORTA SANCTA Ethical Sluice System v1.0

This module implements Layer 4: DEFCON-graded Implementation and Approval for
[cite_start]the PORTA SANCTA workflow. [cite: 127]

Key Responsibilities:
- Present sandbox test results to the Triad Council (ethics, law, economics)
  [cite_start]for final manual review. [cite: 127]
- Record the Triad Council's decision (approve/reject).
- If approved, assign a DEFCON level that reflects the proposal's
  [cite_start]inherent risk. [cite: 128]
- Manage the incremental rollout of the new feature into the operational
  [cite_start]environment, with full rollback capabilities activated. [cite: 128]
- [cite_start]Log decision protocols for external oversight by the UN observer. [cite: 135]
