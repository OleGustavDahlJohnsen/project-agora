Project Agora: PORTA SANCTA - Proposal Handler
Part of the PORTA SANCTA Ethical Sluice System v1.0

This module implements Layer 1: Submission of Proposals for the PORTA SANCTA
[cite_start]workflow. [cite: 19, 116]

Key Responsibilities:
- Provide a dedicated interface for certified users and developers to submit
  [cite_start]proposals for new features, algorithms, or ethical adjustments. [cite: 117]
- Ensure every proposal includes a description of its purpose, expected impact,
  [cite_start]and a self-evaluation against Lex Concordia. [cite: 118]
- Manage the appeal process for rejected proposals, forwarding them to an
  [cite_start]independent committee under the Chimera Council. [cite: 133, 134]
