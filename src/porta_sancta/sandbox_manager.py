Project Agora: PORTA SANCTA - Sandbox Manager
Part of the PORTA SANCTA Ethical Sluice System v1.0

This module implements Layer 3: Simulated Testing in SANCTUM Sandbox for the
[cite_start]PORTA SANCTA workflow. [cite: 21, 124]

Key Responsibilities:
- [cite_start]Receive proposals that have passed the automatic security clearance. [cite: 125]
- [cite_start]Instantiate an isolated "sandbox" version of ADAM in a SANCTUM environment. [cite: 125]
- Interface with the 'virtual_life' simulation to run a series of stress
  [cite_start]tests on the proposal. [cite: 126]
- Identify potential negative consequences, systemic instability, or unforeseen
  [cite_start]ethical conflicts without any risk to the main system. [cite: 126]
- [cite_start]Generate a detailed report of the test results for the Triad Council. [cite: 127]
