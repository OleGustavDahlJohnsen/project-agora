Project Agora: PORTA SANCTA - Security Scanner
Part of the PORTA SANCTA Ethical Sluice System v1.0

This module implements Layer 2: Automatic Security Clearance of the
[cite_start]PORTA SANCTA workflow. [cite: 20, 119]

Key Responsibilities:
- Act as the first line of automated ethical and security defense for new
  [cite_start]proposals. [cite: 120]
- Employ a Semantic Monitor (NLP algorithm) to analyze proposals for
  [cite_start]hidden intentions or manipulative language. [cite: 121]
- Check proposals against a continuously updated Trigger Blacklist and
  [cite_start]Whitelist of function calls and behavioral patterns. [cite: 122]
- Validate the proposal against a database of regulatory doctrines,
  [cite_start]including the EU AI Act and UN guidelines. [cite: 123]
