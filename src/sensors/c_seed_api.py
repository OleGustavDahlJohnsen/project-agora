Project Agora: C-SEED API Module
Part of the CHIMERA SANCTUM Architecture v1.0

Implements C-SEED (Chimera Sensory Extension & Ethical Deployment), an API/SDK
that gives ADAM the ability to extend itself with new sensor technology in a
[cite_start]controlled and ethically secure manner. [cite: 182, 183]

Key Responsibilities:
- Implement the Sensor Discovery Layer to scan for and identify new,
  [cite_start]connected sensor technology. [cite: 185]
- Run the Ethical Driver Negotiator (EDN) to assess a new sensor's potential
  [cite_start]impact on privacy, security, and ethics against Lex Concordia. [cite: 186]
- Package the new driver in a reversible "Rollback Container" for safe
  [cite_start]implementation, upon approval from the Architect and Triad Council. [cite: 187]
