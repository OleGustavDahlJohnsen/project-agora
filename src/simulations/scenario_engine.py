Project Agora: Simulation Scenario Engine
Part of The Concordia Project

This module is responsible for loading and executing specific ethical
dilemmas and stress-test scenarios within the Symbiotic Genesis simulation.

Key Responsibilities:
- Load scenario definitions from external files (e.g., YAML or JSON).
- Inject specific events, entities, or environmental changes into the
  main simulation at the right time.
- Monitor the simulation for success/failure conditions of a given scenario.
- Provide a structured way to stress-test the AI's adherence to its
  Main Directive under pressure.
