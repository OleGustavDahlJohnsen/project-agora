"""
Project Agora: Symbiotic Genesis Simulation
Part of The Concordia Project v8.2

This module is the main engine for the 'Symbiotic Genesis' life simulation,
[cite_start]which emerged from "Project Virtual Life". [cite: 79] This method of development
ensures that the frameworks are robust and tested through lived, narrative
[cite_start]experience. [cite: 80]

Key Responsibilities:
- Create and manage the state of the simulated world and its inhabitants.
- Run the main simulation loop (tick-based).
- Apply the rules of the 'Simulation's Constitution' to all events.
- Provide a rich environment for A.D.A.M. and other agents to be tested in,
  [cite_start]especially during PORTA SANCTA's sandbox phase. [cite: 231]
