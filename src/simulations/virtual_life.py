"""
Project Agora: Symbiotic Genesis Simulation
Part of The Concordia Project

This module is the main engine for the 'Symbiotic Genesis' life simulation,
used to develop and test complex ethical frameworks in a dynamic environment.

Key Responsibilities:
- Create and manage the state of the simulated world and its inhabitants.
- Run the main simulation loop (tick-based).
- Apply the rules of the 'Simulation's Constitution' to all events.
- Provide a rich environment for A.D.A.M. and other agents to be tested in.
